Bengaluru Home Value Explorer Project

Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting home prices in Bangalore using a machine learning model built with Scikit-learn. By leveraging a dataset from Kaggle, the project entails data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and deployment via a Flask server. Users can easily input property features through a web interface to obtain real-time price predictions.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Load and clean the dataset for analysis.
Outlier Detection: Identify and remove anomalous data points to enhance accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Develop meaningful features to boost model performance.
Dimensionality Reduction: Streamline features for improved efficiency.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using GridSearchCV.
Cross-Validation: Ensure robustness with K-Fold Cross Validation.
Model Deployment: Provide a Flask API for serving predictions.
User-Friendly Interface: A web interface designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user inputs and displaying results.
